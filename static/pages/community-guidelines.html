  <h1>Community Guidelines for Belong</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>Be civil towards other members of the community. While you are free to hold and voice your opinions, be accommodating and sensitive towards the views of other community members.</li>

    <li>Do not use  profane, derogatory or threatening language.</li>

    <li>Do not post racist, sexist, abusive, vulgar, offensive, intolerant, distasteful or sexual content  or portray any such behaviour  while interacting with the community.</li>

    <li>Posting the same discussion topic on multiple room at the same time or across a period of 1 week will be considered as spam and may result in immediate ban from the community.</li>

    <li>Do not post or participate in conversations that are against the law. Participating, suggesting, or encouraging illegal activity may result in immediate ban from Belong and may have legal consequences.</li>

    <li>Do not resort to &ldquo;Trolling&rdquo; other community members or post comments purely with the intention of disrupting or sidetracking an ongoing conversation.</li>

    <li>Do not start discussion threads solely with the purpose of selling or promoting your  business.</li>

    <li>Do not collect private information about another community member without their knowledge. Expressing intent of stalking or engaging in any activity on the community that implies the same will result in being banned from the community and may have legal consequences.</li>

    <li>Belong gives you a choice of picking up your own username. However, do not impersonate another individual or take another person&rsquo;s identity without their explicit permission.</li>

    <li>Belong is a public platform and information on Belong is accessible to everyone who is following the community. Do not post any information about yourself or your business that you deem private and do not wish to be publicly available.</li>

    <li>Be cautious while exchanging information, content or deals (personal, copyrighted or otherwise)  with other community members. While Belong is a platform for collaboration, we urge you to do your background checks and practice due diligence about the concerned community member before any such  exchange as it may be misused.</li>

    <li>Note that community members may claim professional expertise that we have no way of verifying. Do a background check while engaging their services or use your discretion while taking into consideration any advice on the app.</li>
